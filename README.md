<h2>Description</h2>

Ask:
As a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, my task is to analyze smart device usage data and gain insights into how consumers are using non-Bellabeat smart devices. This analysis will help us understand the trends in smart device usage, how these trends apply to Bellabeat customers, and how they can influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

Prepare:
To conduct the analysis, I will utilize the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users, including information on daily activity, steps, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. I will download and store the data appropriately for analysis.

Process:
Once the data is obtained, I will check its organization and format. I will ensure that it is in a suitable format for analysis, such as a structured format with relevant columns and consistent data types. I will also address any issues of bias, credibility, or data quality that may arise from using the FitBit dataset. Additionally, I will verify the data's integrity and document any cleaning or manipulation steps taken.

Analyze:
In the analysis phase, I will aggregate and format the data for easy accessibility. I will perform calculations and statistical analysis to identify trends and relationships in smart device usage. This may involve exploring metrics such as daily activity levels, steps taken, heart rate patterns, and sleep duration. By analyzing these trends, I will extract insights and draw conclusions about how consumers are using smart devices.

Share:
To effectively communicate the findings, I will create supporting visualizations using tools such as ggplot or Tableau. These visualizations will highlight the key trends and insights discovered in the analysis. I will ensure that the visualizations are clear, concise, and visually appealing. I will also prepare a summary of the analysis, including the main findings and their implications for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

Act:
Based on the analysis, I will provide high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy. These recommendations will be rooted in the insights gained from the smart device usage data. I will propose actionable steps that Bellabeat can take to leverage the identified trends and align their marketing efforts with the evolving needs and preferences of consumers. Additionally, I will consider the possibility of incorporating additional data sources to further enhance the analysis and recommendations.

In conclusion, by following the ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act framework, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of smart device usage data to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy. The insights and recommendations derived from this analysis will help Bellabeat capitalize on emerging trends and better serve their customers in the wellness technology market.
